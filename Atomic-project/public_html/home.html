            <p>Atomic Habits is a book written by James Clear that focuses on small, incremental changes that can lead to big improvements in our habits and ultimately our lives.The book emphasizes the importance of forming good habits and breaking bad ones by making small, consistent changes over time. The idea is that these small changes, or "atomic habits," can compound over time and lead to significant improvements in our behavior and overall well-being. Atomic Habits explores the concept of habit stacking, which involves piggybacking new habits onto existing ones to enhance their stickiness. Clear also reveals the importance of identity and how aligning our habits with our desired self-image can lead to lasting behavior change. </p>
